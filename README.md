Translation from FOL to LTL+Past and LTL, via separation of LTL+Past

The general idea, algorithms and proofs of correctness can be found in doc/paper.pdf

There is a simple interpreter to play around with separation available at http://drdo.eu/sep
This was compiled with GHCJS and all computation happens on the client.
